To implement these changes:

For Home page slider images:

Create a public/images folder in your project
Add your images there (e.g., slider1.jpg, slider2.jpg, etc.)
Update the images array in ImageSlider.tsx with your image paths
Recommended image size: 1600x900px for optimal display
For Gallery images:

Similarly, add your gallery images to the public/images folder
Update the coverImage URLs in the categories array in Gallery.tsx
Recommended image size: 800x600px for gallery thumbnails
For the Contact form:

I've integrated Formspree as a simple solution for form submissions
Go to Formspree
Create a free account
Create a new form and get your form ID
Replace YOUR_FORM_ID in the Contact.tsx file with your actual Formspree form ID
The contact form now includes:

Form validation
Loading state
Success/error messages
Proper email delivery to your inbox
